# Employee-Face-Mask-Detection-Alert-System
Developed a Computer Vision project to detect employees entering into premises without mask in real time using OpenCV, Tensorflow and Keras library on kaggle face mask dataset. Integerated the Computer Vision Model with an alert system to recognise employees using face recognition library and notify authorities about violation of COVID-19 protocol through an email containing the name of employee and time of entering, at the same time keeping a log of all such violators in a CSV file containing the names and time. Also, used python's text-to-speech library for prompting an alert message to remind all such violators of wearing their masks.
